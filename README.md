# SignalCliWrapper

## Project Overview
SignalCliWrapper is a PHP class that acts as a wrapper around the command-line interface (CLI) of Signal, a private messenger application. This wrapper allows developers to easily integrate Signal messaging functionality into their PHP applications by simplifying the interaction with the Signal CLI. It provides methods for registration, verification, messaging, group management, and more.

## Installation
To use SignalCliWrapper in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/signal-cli-wrapper.git
   cd signal-cli-wrapper
   ```

2. **Ensure PHP is installed**:
   Make sure you have PHP installed (version 7.2 or higher is recommended).

3. **Include the class in your project**:
   You can include `SignalCliWrapper.php` in your PHP project by using the `require` or `include` statement:
   ```php
   require 'SignalCliWrapper.php';
   ```

4. **Install Signal CLI**:
   Follow the [official Signal CLI installation instructions](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli#installation) to install the Signal CLI on your system.

## Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use the `SignalCliWrapper` class:

```php
require 'SignalCliWrapper.php';

// Create an instance of the SignalCliWrapper
$signal = new SignalCliWrapper('/path/to/signal-cli', 'your_account', SignalCliWrapper::FORMAT_JSON);

// Register a new account (captchas can be handled as needed)
$signal->register('your_captcha_if_needed');

// Verify your account with the received verification code
$signal->verify('your_verification_code');

// Send a message
$recipients = ['+1234567890'];
$message = 'Hello, this is a test message!';
$signal->send($recipients, $message);
```
